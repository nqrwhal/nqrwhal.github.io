### First Test

For my first test, I decided to use 12.md as the test file. This is the [link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/12.md). I am just going to be comparing the two results.

### Results

This is my implementation:

This is the provided implementation:
![img2](https://github.com/nqrwhal/nqrwhal.github.io/blob/master/imgs/l5i2.jpg?raw=true)

The provided implementation creates an infinite loop, whereas mine returns an empty array, meaning no links. The expected output of this is an empty array. I'm not quite sure what why the infinite loop happens but it definitely because of the for loops.


### Second Test

For the second test I will be using 170.md. Here is the [link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/170.md) to the file.
