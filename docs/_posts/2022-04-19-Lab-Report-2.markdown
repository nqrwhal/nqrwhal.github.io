There's no way to avoid it. Professionally, you *will* have to work with others, and it's best to learn how to do so early on.

Here is the code my group was given at the beginning of the assignment:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nqrwhal/14b196f73020ba24b987d15c64861cfa.js"></script>

From the first impression, we could already tell that this implementation of the code would be susceptible to various errors, bugs, and edge cases. The goal of the program is to parse any valid links from a markdown file and return them via console output. However, because of the way in which the program determined what was a URL and what wasn't, it resulted in plenty of bugs. A simple rewrite I did implemented a slightly more reliable system to check the file line by line.

Here is an example of a file that would have caused a fatal error in the previous code, but passes without fail in my revision:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nqrwhal/a7d5ff070e4cab86f569ac448ea6582d.js"></script>
We run into heap space errors due to an infinite loop.

The bug in this case, is found in the empty lines at the end of the file. Because the code is written improperly with loops, the program enters an infinite loop and eventually the machine runs out of memory. My new approach turned the lines of the markdown file into an ArrayList of Strings, and deals with each one separately. 


Comparing the rewritten code to the original code, it is clear that my first rewrite handled several of the problems.

After a considerable amount of consideration and testing, the following is the perfected code which can detect all of the bugs that had previously plagued the earlier code. It can parse multiple URLs per line, as well as detect, handle, and subsequently ignore malformed markdown links.
## Blame from rev 2 to final rev:

Here is the code. I am quite proud of this solution:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nqrwhal/7aaa31fcbda4f57c6fc7a49f204d63ca.js"></script>


Here is an example of a markdown file which would crash my previous code:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nqrwhal/3cd18b537acc355ceb1313f9b34c6f81.js"></script>
With the new and vastly improved error handling and accounting for edge cases, the new and updated code handles this with ease. Whereas running the older code with this file would produce malformed links, as well as false positives, this new code performs as it should.
