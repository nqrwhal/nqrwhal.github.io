### Markdown Parser

For this lab report, we were tasked with testing our own implementations of the markdown parser against a specific implementation we used in a lab. There are three snippets of code supplied, and we run each snippet through both implementations for six total tests.

This is the implementation I wrote: [myParse](https://github.com/nqrwhal/markdown-parser)

This is the implementation we reviewed: [exampleParse](https://github.com/canitry/markdown-parser)


### First Snippet
``` 
`[a link`](url.com)

[another link](`google.com)`

[`cod[e`](google.com)

[`code]`](ucsd.edu) 
```

### Second Snippet

```
[a [nested link](a.com)](b.com)

[a nested parenthesized url](a.com(()))

[some escaped \[ brackets \]](example.com)
```

### Third Snippet
```
[this title text is really long and takes up more than 
one line

and has some line breaks](
    https://www.twitter.com
)

[this title text is really long and takes up more than 
one line](

)


[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis](github.com

And there's still some more text after that.

[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis for a while](https://cse.ucsd.edu/



)

And then there's more text
```

### The results:
This is the my implementation and the first snippet:

![mine1](https://github.com/nqrwhal/nqrwhal.github.io/blob/master/imgs/mine1.jpg?raw=true)

The expected results were obtained after running the test. Only correctly formatted links were returned.
Second snippet:

![mine2](https://github.com/nqrwhal/nqrwhal.github.io/blob/master/imgs/mine2.jpg?raw=true)
For this snippet, we expected all three links to be rendered, but my implementation only correctly returned the first one. The second one was improperly parsed, and the third one ignored due to the escaped brackets.

Third Snippet:

![mine3](https://github.com/nqrwhal/nqrwhal.github.io/blob/master/imgs/mine3.jpg?raw=true)
For the third snippet, only the schedule link should be returned. However, my implementation uses a line by line approach that fails in parsing the link properly.

Example Implementation 1st snippet: 

![ex1](https://github.com/nqrwhal/nqrwhal.github.io/blob/master/imgs/ex1.jpg?raw=true)

Second snippet:

![ex2](https://github.com/nqrwhal/nqrwhal.github.io/blob/master/imgs/ex2.jpg?raw=true)

Third snippet:

![ex3](https://github.com/nqrwhal/nqrwhal.github.io/blob/master/imgs/ex3.jpg?raw=true)
