### Markdown Parser

For this lab report, we were tasked with testing our own implementations of the markdown parser against a specific implementation we used in a lab. There are three snippets of code supplied, and we run each snippet through both implementations for six total tests.

This is the implementation I wrote: [myParse](https://github.com/nqrwhal/markdown-parser)

This is the implementation we reviewed: [exampleParse](https://github.com/canitry/markdown-parser)
