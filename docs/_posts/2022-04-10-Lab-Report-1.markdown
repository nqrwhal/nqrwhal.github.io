For the first lab, we learned how to use the SSH protocol to remotely access UCSD's ieng6 servers. Here's a guide on how we did it.

## Installing Visual Stuio Code

- The installation process of VS Code is pretty well documented on their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You can follow the steps there to install and configure it properly.

## Remotely Connecting to ieng6

- First, you must retrieve your course specific username for the class you are trying to connect to ieng6 for. You can find it [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
- If you are using a Windows OS, you need to install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). Otherwise, Mac and Linux users will already have SSH clients preinstalled.
- VS Code has a built in feature to streamline the remote connection option. We will follow the documentation [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host).
- After opening a terminal, you will enter the following command:   `ssh cs15lsp22**@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. Replace the `**` with the two letters corresponding to your account. Reply `yes` to any prompts and continue. 
- A prompt asking for your password will appear. Enter your password and continue. If you haven't reset your password for the course account yet, you can do so [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).

## Simple Unix Commands to try

- `cd ~`
- `cd`
- `ls -lat`
- `ls -a`
- `exit` (Note: this command will log you out of your SSH session)

## Using SCP to transfer files between your computer and your server
- A useful application of SSH is to transfer files between computers remotely. You can learn more about the usage of SCP by running `scp help` in the terminal.
- Create a text file and name it something cool. Then, try running the following command: `scp [filename].txt cs15lsp22**@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/` where you replace filename with the name of the file, and the `**` with your two letter id. 
- After entering your password, the file should beging transferring. You can check if the transfer was successful by running `ls -lat` on the server and noting if the file is present.

## SSH Keys
- SSH keys are a way for you to authenticate an SSH connection without typing your password every time you want to connect to a server or use SCP to transfer a file.
- You can use `ssh-keygen` to generate an SSH keypair.
- Once you have the ssh public key file, you can `mkdir .ssh` on the server, and use SCP to transfer the key file.
- If you did it right, you should be able to ssh without authentication.

## Optimizing remote running
- You can use the remote servers to run java files, while making edits on your local computer. You can use a script to speed up the process.
