For the first lab, we learned how to use the SSH protocol to remotely access UCSD's ieng6 servers. Here's a guide on how we did it.

## Installing Visual Stuio Code 
- The installation process of VS Code is pretty well documented on their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You can follow the steps there to install and configure it properly.

## Remotely Connecting to ieng6
- First, you must retrieve your course specific username for the class you are trying to connect to ieng6 for. You can find it [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
- If you are using a Windows OS, you need to install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). Otherwise, Mac and Linux users will already have SSH clients preinstalled.
- VS Code has a built in feature to streamline the remote connection option. We will follow the documentation [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host).
- After opening a terminal, you will enter the following command: `ssh cs15lsp22**@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. Replace the `**` with the two letters corresponding to your account. Reply `yes` to any prompts and continue. 
- A prompt asking for your password will appear. Enter your password and continue. If you haven't reset your password for the course account yet, you can do so [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).
